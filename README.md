You can work through the exercises 1 - 5 by checking out the corresponding `exerciseX` branch. Solutions are available on `exerciseX-solution` branches.

For example, to get started checkout the `exercise1` branch and then open the tests (Exercise1KtTest) and implementation file (exercise1.kt). To view the solutions, checkout `exercise1-solution`
