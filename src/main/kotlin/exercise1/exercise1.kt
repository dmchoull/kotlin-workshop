// Exercise 1: Basics
// https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-types.html
// https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/functions.html
// https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html

// 🧠 define a variable named "theAnswer" with the value 42



// 🧠 define a function "greet" that returns the string "Hello, [insert name here]!", given a name



// 🧠 define a function "add" which calculates the sum of two integers



// 🧠 define a function "sum" which calculates the sum of a list of integers
// without using the sum function from the kotlin standard library (ℹ️ i.e. write a for( ... in ...) loop)
// bonus: reuse the code between both versions

// 🧠 version one: accept an argument of type List<Int>



// 🧠 version two: accept a vararg Int argument
// https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/functions.html#variable-number-of-arguments-varargs



// 🧠 extend the Int type with even and odd functions



// 🧠 write a function "median" that can be called on any list of integers to calculate the median

// Definition: The median of a set of data is the middlemost number in the set. The median is also
// the number that is halfway into the set. To find the median, the data should first be arranged
// in order from least to greatest.

// If there are an odd number of elements then it is the middle element. Otherwise it is calculated
// by taking the average of the two middle numbers.
